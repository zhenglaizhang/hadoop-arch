# The first port, 2888, is mostly used for peer-to-peer communication in the quorum, such as to connect followers to leaders. A follower opens a TCP connection to the leader using this port.
# The second port, 3888, is used for leader election, in case a new leader arises in the quorum. As all communication happens over TCP, a second port is required to respond to leader election inside the quorum.
# Servers listen on three ports: 2181 for client connections; 2888 for follower connections, if they are the leader; and 3888 for other server connections during the leader election phase.
# When a ZooKeeper server starts up, it reads the myid file to determine which server it is
