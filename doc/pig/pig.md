### Pig vs SQL

* Pig Latin is a data flow programming language, whereas SQL is a declarative programming language
* programming in Pig Latin is like working at the level of an RDBMS query planner, which figures out how to turn a declarative statement into a system of steps.
* Pigâ€™s support for complex, nested data structures further differentiates it from SQL, which operates on flatter data structures.
* Hive (covered in Chapter 17) sits between Pig and conventional RDBMSs.
